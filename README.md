Another Codeacademy project. 
This time we were tasked with creating this webpage for a tea shop using the resources and specification sheet provided. 
This was part of the Module on Flexbox. 

I must admit i struggled a bit with the flexbox and im sure more advanced developers will find the CSS amusing as i think theres possibly quite a bit of redundant CSS Selectors and Selectors.
I managed to get most of the website to spec, with the only key difference being i used Sticky positioning for the NavBar.
alot learned here.
